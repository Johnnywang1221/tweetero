= Goals for version 2.0 =

  * Support Multiple Twitter accounts

  * Search Twitter (see Tweetie as example)

  * Video playback via Safari
  * Support OAUth
  * Use In-App Email sending form
  * Remove "Re-tweet" button from Direct Message view.
  * Turning screen sideways should launch camera mode after which it should switch to new tweet creation (enable quick camera mode, 10 seconds)
  * Add nice icons to each menu item
